## WhatsThat
An android riddle game app.

#The idea
An android application created for and with Android-Studio. It's a cooperation between me and my brother and a playground for various minigames and ideas. All riddle types have the central idea to find the solution to an arbitrary image provided and hidden by the riddle. The riddles are not hard to solve and require mostly linear and straightforward solving techniques. The act of solving the riddle is meant to be the enjoyable part, the design of the riddles should be so entertaining that entering the solution is only the secondary aim.

#Working progress
As I am a student of mathematics and not directly into computer science this is a playground for coding and image processing for me. My brother does not work on the code but rather on the development of the ideas, collection of images, general design and the testing. 

#Contribution
You will not be able to compile and build the project in android-studio, as the Riddle package is missing. I plan to make the project open source, but so far we do not know yet if and how we might be trying to earn some cents for the time invested. Though I hate ads and do not plan on adding them. If anyone is interested in some implementations or details or even the whole code, contact me. If you want to suggest ideas or improvements, feel free to contact me too! I would love have some feedback. :)

#Riddles
Circle: The image is hidden by the brightness of the pixels and overlayed with grey circles. Circles can be split into 4 smaller circles and the original image get more and more recognizable as the circles shrink in size.

Dice: A riddle based on randomness of throwing dices on a fixed size square field. Dices can be moved horizontally and vertically and combined if they are equal in number and color. Based on the number and color, parts of the underlying image will have their opacity increased.
